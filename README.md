# Tempest PZ Manager

## üìä Project Status
**Current Version:** `v0.1.0 - Early Development`


This server manager was made by an _inexperienced_ developer, so feel free to request any functions you would like added in the future. 
This is not the _final_ version of this PZ server manager; I am just starting. 
Found a bug? Try fixing the code yourself or put it on the "_Issues_" page so I can look it up when I have some time.
